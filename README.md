# Social Network API

## Description
This README describes a social networking website that uses an express.js API interacting with a NoSQL database. 

## Installation
This application is not deployed but its functionality can be seen in the walkthrough video linked below.

## Usage
This application uses an Express.js back end to connect to a NoSQL database to handle large amounts of unstructured data.  It uses MongoDB with mongoose models.

Since this website is not deployed, a walkthrough using Insomnia is linked below. The walkthrough demonstrates the GET routes for all users, an individual user, a POST route for adding a user, a PUT route for changing a user's information and a DELETE route for removing a user.

It also demonstrates adding and deleting a Friend for the user. When a Friend is added, the user and the Friend are linked so they reciprocally show up as a Friend to each other.

Th video also shows the GET routes for all thoughts, the GET route for an individual thought, a POST route for adding a thought, a PUT route for changing a thought and a DELETE route for removing a thought.

It also shows adding and deleting a reaction to a thought.
